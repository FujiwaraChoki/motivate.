# motivate.

"motivate." is a simple Chrome Extension which shows you a random motivational quote,
everytime you open a new website/tab. `Google.com` domains are excluded, as it would
be annoying to see a quote everytime you search for something.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FujiwaraChoki/motivate..git
```

2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`

3. Enable `Developer mode` in the top right corner

4. Click on `Load unpacked` and select the `motivate.` folder

5. You're done! Enjoy your new motivational quotes!
